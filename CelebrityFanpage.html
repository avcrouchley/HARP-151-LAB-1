<body>Lionel Messi was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency at just 10 years of age, which required expensive treatment his family couldn't afford. With no club willing to pay for his treatment in Argentina, the family moved to Spain to help their child realize his dream of becoming a professional footballer. Barcelona decided to lend a helping hand after Messi impressed them with his talent. The <i>Blaugrana</i> covered the cost of his treatment and gave him a chance at the club. Mysteriously, his first contract was signed on a napkin. Fast-forward 21 years and the Argentine has established himself as the greatest player in the club's history. He bagged a whopping 672 goals and 301 assists for the Catalan giants in 778 appearances, leading them to claim 35 trophies before leaving for PSG this summer.
